# Python Code for Coursera Machine Learning

This repo proivdes python-based solutions to the Coursera Machine Learning
course taught by professor Andrew NG.

Solutions mimic the MATLAB/Octave code provided through Coursera. The scikit-learn module provides canned implementations for each of these algorithms, but at the potential expense of understanding how they work. These basic versions are being used to solidify concepts and gain familiarity with the Python scientific computing stack.

## Orgnaization of repo
Unlike in the coursera course, individual functions are not written in seperate
scripts. Instead, a single script is included to store all of the helper
functions for each exercise.
